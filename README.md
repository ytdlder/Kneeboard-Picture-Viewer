### HowTo
After starting the program, you'll be asked to specifiy a directory with your Kneeboard folders and images inside them:<br>
<img src="gitimg/info_1.png" width="400px" />

The folder structure should look like this:<br>
<img src="gitimg/info_2.png" />

... and the content like this:<br>
<img src="gitimg/info_3.png" />

After that you can click through the folders and images, or use your keyboard:
* folder up/down = Ctrl + Alt + arrow Left / Right
* file up/down = Ctrl + Alt + arrow Up / Down
* first file = Shift + Ctrl + Alt + Up

You can change your colors and the font in the apps settings.
